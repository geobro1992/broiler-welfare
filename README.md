### Simple Summary of Results
Broiler chickens are usually housed in high-density, relatively barren conditions that limit their opportunities to express natural behaviors and be active. This study aimed to investigate the effects of complex environments and stocking densities on broiler behavior. Frequency and duration of broiler chicken behaviors, such as preening, dustbathing, foraging, and play were recorded at different time points when birds were 2, 4, and 7 weeks old. We found that environmental complexity positively influenced foraging, locomotion, preening, and overall activity. Yet dustbathing and play were not affected by the complexity of the environment. High stocking density resulted in more frequent but not longer activity overall, but less frequent foraging, drinking, and eating, which suggests disturbances. As chickens aged, their activity levels reduced, and they showed increased signs of frustration. However, the benefits of environmental complexity and low density persisted. Overall, providing a complex environment with low stocking density can enhance broiler chicken welfare by stimulating their natural behaviors.
